#### About

**[TAX](https://taxesandmoretaxes.com)** was created as a cheeky response to the ever-increasing taxation on cryptocurrencies and  the relentless attempts by governments to take a cut of every transaction. In a world where taxes only seem to increase, **[TAX](https://taxesandmoretaxes.com)** is a reminder that while traditional taxes are mandatory and often give you nothing in return, this is the only "tax" that is voluntary—and one you can take back whenever you actually need something.

With the slogan “Tired of getting nothing for your taxes?”, **[TAX](https://taxesandmoretaxes.com)** exposes the absurdity of a system where people are forced to give away their money with no control over how it’s used. Unlike real taxes, **[TAX](https://taxesandmoretaxes.com)** doesn’t disappear into a bureaucratic black hole—it stays in your hands, ready to be used however you see fit.

The value of **[TAX](https://taxesandmoretaxes.com)** isn’t just in the token itself—it’s in the message it represents. Every transaction is a protest against excessive taxation, a rejection of unjust financial burdens, and a reminder that people should have the right to decide what happens to their own money.

If you’ve ever felt the frustration of watching your earnings disappear into endless taxes, then **[TAX](https://taxesandmoretaxes.com)** is more than just a token—it’s a symbol of that frustration. It exists as a statement of resistance, a reflection of the unfair system, and—above all—a message to those who believe they’re entitled to your money.
